### Getting Started

1. `npm install`

### Self Analysis

1. `cd packages/package-inspector`
2. `./bin/index.js --report`
   > This will create a `/report` directory with an `index.html` that contains the interactive html report. Optionally, a `DEV_SERVER` environment variable can be used to provide a served version of the html report.
   >
   > `DEV_SERVER=true ./bin/index.js --report` will create a live report at `http://localhost:8000/` which rebuilds with changes made in `package-inspector-ui`.
